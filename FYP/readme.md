## This folder contains example Python programs for speech emotion recognition (SER) using the IEMOCAP corpus. The programs perform leave-one-session-out (ser_session.py) and leave-one-speaker-out (ser_speaker.py) cross-validation.

## The programs should be run under the "programs/" folder. The IEMOCAP dataset should be put under the "IEMOCAP_full_release/" folder. All label files should be put inside the "labels/" folder.
