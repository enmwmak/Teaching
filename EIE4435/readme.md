# EIE4435 Lab Exercise on Digital Audio and Speech Enhancement

## Objectives
1. Enable students to understand the dithering process and how it helps alleviate the detrimental effect of quantization error, especially on low-amplitude signals.
2. Facilitate students to understand the effect of quantization error and dithering through changing the bit depth and varying the additive noise.
3. Enable students to understand the spectral subtraction algorithm and the artifacts it produces, especially on speech signals with low SNR.
4. Allow students to investigate the effect of changing the over-subtraction factor and noise floor on the denoised speech.

## Procedures for this lab exercise
1. Download the lab materials from https://github.com/enmwmak/Teaching/tree/main/EIE4435 using https://download-directory.github.io/. Depending on the operating system of your local computer, this step either creates a folder "enmwmak Teaching main EIE4435" or a ZIP file named "enmwmak Teaching main EIE4435.zip" under your Download folder.
1. Create a folder "EIE4435/Lab" on your local computer or your Google Drive.
2. Copy the folders "AudioFiles" and "Programs" from the downloaded folder to your "EIE4435/Lab" folder. 
4. Load the file "Digital_Audio.ipynb" to Visual Studio Code or Google Colab. Follow the procedures in this file and answer the questions. Put your observations and answers in your report.
5. Load the file "Speech_Enhance.ipynb" to Visual Studio Code or Google Colab. Follow the procedures in this file and answer the questions. Put your observations and answers in your report.

You may either use Visual Studio Code (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) or Google Colab (see https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-google-colab/) to complete this lab exercise.
