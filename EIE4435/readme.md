## Objectives
1. Enable students to understand the dithering process and how it helps alleviate the detrimental effect of quantization error, especially on low-amplitude signals.
2. Allow students to appreciate the effect of quantization error and dithering through changing the bit depth and the amount of noise to be added to the signal.
3. Enable students to understand the spectral subtraction algorithm and the artifacts it produces, especially on low SNR speech signals.
4. Allow students to investigate the effect of changing the over-subtraction factor and noise floor on the denoised speech.

## Procedures for this lab exercise
1. Create a folder structure similar to this repository on your local computer or on your Google Drive.
1. Download the files in the folder "AudioFiles" and copy them to your "AudioFiles" folder.
1. Download the files in the folder "Programs" and copy them to your "Programs" folder.
4. Load the file "Digital_Audio.ipynb" to Visual Studio Code or Google Colab. Follow the procedures in this file and answer the questions. Put your observations and answers in your report.
